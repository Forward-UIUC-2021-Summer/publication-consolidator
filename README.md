# publication-consolidator

This module aggregates information from scraping tasks and from existing knowledge bases (e.g. MAG, OAG) into a unified database for the EducationToday website.

Note that this module does not handle ranking or keyword assignment related data. It only handles core data: descriptive data of each entity (e.g. research position of an author, number of citations for a publication) and core linking relations between each entity (e.g. current institution of professors).
